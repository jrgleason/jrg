# The JRG Web Platform

## Goals

* **Be inclusive:** We are not Angular, Vue, or React developers. We are WEB Developers and we need a big tent.
* **Be Standard:** When there are standards those should be used. When new standards are added the code should be updated.
* **Be Simple:** Try to avoid things like typing and precompiling but without violating the first rule.
* **Be Pragmatic** When all else fails get creative

### Mission Statement: 
  To create a platform to handle my TCP/Internet needs. 

### Help:
  Feel free to make PRs and I will review and accept them. Right now the only end user is myself but hopefully that will expand a but in the future and I want the project to grow with the needs of te community.
